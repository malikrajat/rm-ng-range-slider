## Unsupported Browsers and Platforms

The following browsers and platforms are not supported:

- Legacy Edge (non-Chromium)
- Browsers without ES2015+ support
- Very old Android WebView versions

These environments lack required APIs such as modern Canvas rendering, Blob handling, and reliable file download support.

---

## Known Limitations Across Browsers and OS

While supported environments work reliably, some limitations apply:

- PDF generation may be slower on low-memory devices
- Complex CSS effects may not render identically across browsers
- Fonts loaded from external domains require proper CORS configuration
- Cross-origin images must be configured with appropriate headers
- Large DOM trees may impact performance during export

---

## Best Practices for Compatibility

To ensure consistent behavior across browsers and operating systems:

- Use web-safe fonts or properly embedded custom fonts
- Avoid experimental or browser-specific CSS features
- Ensure all images and assets are fully loaded before export
- Test exports on at least one desktop and one mobile browser
- Prefer Chromium-based browsers for development and testing

## Angular Compatibility

| Angular Version | Support |
|----------------|---------|
| Angular 14 | Supported |
| Angular 15 | Supported |
| Angular 16 | Supported |
| Angular 17 | Supported |
| Angular 18 | Supported |
| Angular 19 | Supported |
| Angular 20 | Supported |
| Angular 21 | Supported |

## Summary

If your application runs on a supported browser and operating system compatible with Angular,  
`rm-ng-range-slider` will function reliably without additional configuration.

For optimal results, use a modern Chromium-based browser on a desktop operating system during development and testing.
